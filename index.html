                <h2>Early Life</h2>
                <p>
                    <li>
                        Mandela was given the name Rolihlahla, which means "troublemaker" in the Xhosa language.
                        He was the youngest of four children.</li>
                    <li>Mandela was nine years old, his father died, and he was sent to live with the chief of the
                        Thembu people, where he was groomed to become a counselor to the monarch.</li>
                    <li>Mandela received his primary education at a local missionary school, where he was given the name
                        "Nelson" by a teacher.</li>
                    <li>In 1939, Mandela enrolled at the University of Fort Hare, the only university for black South
                        Africans at the time, where he studied law.</li>
                    <li>However, Mandela was expelled from the university for participating in a student protest against
                        the university's policies.</li>
                    <li>In 1941, Mandela moved to Johannesburg, where he began working as a night watchman and completed
                        his law degree through the University of South Africa.</li>

                <h2>Contributions</h2>
                <p>
                    <li>Anti-Apartheid Activism: Nelson Mandela was a well-known anti-apartheid activist who devoted his
                        life to eradicating
                        racial inequality and segregation in South Africa. He was a key figure in the African National
                        Congress (ANC), an organisation that used boycotts, civil disobedience, and nonviolent protests
                        to fight apartheid.</li>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <li>Imprisonment: Mandela served a total of 27 years in prison for his anti-apartheid work, the
                        majority of which were spent on Robben Island. Mandela stayed dedicated to his cause despite the
                        unfavourable circumstances and cruel treatment, and his detention further strengthened his
                        status as a remarkable figure of resiliency and resolve.</li>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <li>Negotiations and Reconciliation: Negotiations and Reconciliation: Following his release from
                        jail in 1990, Nelson Mandela was a crucial player in efforts to peacefully abolish apartheid and
                        usher in a democratic transition in South Africa. He promoted forgiveness and reconciliation as
                        a way to mend the scars of the past and strove to create bridges across various racial and
                        ethnic groupings.</li>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <li>Presidency: In a wholly representative democratic election held in 1994, Nelson Mandela was
                        chosen as South Africa's first black president. He led the nation through a challenging time of
                        transition and consolidation while serving as president from 1977 to 1999.</li>
